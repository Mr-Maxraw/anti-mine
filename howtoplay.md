# Anti Mine tutorial

## Game Objective

- To complete the game you need to locate all the mines on the grid.
- There are two types of mines: regular and anti mines.
- The patterns of colors on the board give clues to the locations of mines and anti mines.
- By itself, a mine will brighten the surrounding safe tiles. Likewise, an anti mine will darken its surrounding safe tiles. 
- Be careful, these two effects will cancel each other out if a mine and anti mine are in close proximity! This is reffered to as two mines annihilating eachother. 


## Controls
